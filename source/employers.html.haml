      %h3 What they learn
      %p
        %span
          Learning to be a developer at Makers Academy is less about
          %em what you know
          and more about
          %em how you do it.
      %p
        %em Attitude -
        Students learn how to solve problems for themselves, to find their own answers.
      %p
        %em Behaviour -
        They're pair-programming 80% of the time, working in scrum teams on projects and writing clean, maintainable code.
      %p
        %em Technology -
        Our curriculum is mainly Ruby and Javascript, but students often teach themselves all manner of other technologies.

          %h4.alt-color you get all of the above, unlimited, for free
          %h4.subheader You only pay when you find someone you like
          %p Unlike other coding bootcamps, we charge a fee for recruitment - which means we're incentivised at every point of our process to produce phenomenally employable people.
          %p You don't pay a penny for engaging with our graduates, whether you're attending our careers fair, or simply posting a job - you only pay when you find someone you like.
          %p Our fee is also greater than some other sources of recruitment, because working with Makers Academy is much more than simply getting a list of keyword-matched CVs. We know our candidates inside-out, we're technologists and educators, not salespeople - and we care about creating the next generation of exceptional software developers.
