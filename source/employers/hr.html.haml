      %p When you invest in the brilliance, enthusiasm and tenacity of a junior developer, youâ€™re investing in building a focused, talented and loyal workforce. Most Makers Academy developers have already found success in other industries, so they add value to teams beyond the code. This makes them better candidates for your roles.

      We focus on the quality, consistency and integrity of our developers. To make sure we work with only the most determined and passionate people, we accept just 10% of applicants onto our course.
    %p
      Intensive training means our developers are advocates of TDD, pair programming, and SOLID and Agile principles. They write quality Ruby and JavaScript code that's a pleasure to read. They learn how to solve problems for themselves by finding their own answers to real-life situations.
    %p
      We firmly believe in quality over quantity, and after 800+ hours of intensive training at Makers Academy, we know our developers inside-out. We'll work with you to help you invest in a junior developer who will make a real difference to your organisation.
    %p
      Put simply - better developers, brought to you.
